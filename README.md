# ClothingCollector
A program to collect the names, and that of the ID's of publically available Roblox Group Clothing Items.

# Required Imports
The required imports and packages to run on Python, 3.9+ which is how I ran it are the following.

- from asyncio import sleep
- import urllib
- from urllib.request import urlopen
- import json
- import time

# Setup Program
This is how to setup the program:

- On line 12 of the program itself, please enter the Roblox Group ID so you can download the clothing ID's and the information from there onto the name of the file that will be created from Line 11.

That's about all there really is, it will take a bit to run over time especially with large groups but it does work in producing the Data requested.

Have fun,
James. S
